# Rain-Forecast
A machine learning application that predicts rain.

The dataset we will use in this project includes daily weather observations from multiple Australian weather stations. 
Our Goal: Did it rain the next day? Yes or no. 

You can access this data at https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package. Or https://raw.githubusercontent.

You can pull data from com/amounsey/AustraliaRainPrediction/master/data/weather.csv Also available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/extensive-analysis-eda-fe-modelling and https://www.kaggle We also took advantage of that of .com/aninditapani/will-it-rain-tomorrow.
